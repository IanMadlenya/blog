Boost libraries (Boost.Thread) provide an easy implementation for multi-threading applications in C++.
Code is portable on different OS platforms. Three basic code examples are discussed below for a kick start on use of these libraries.
Last example also shows the use of mutex.
On Linux, it uses pthreads underlying. So it can be thought of pthreads wrapped in C++ style objects. BOOST library provides different ways to use locks also.

[Here][boost] is the official link.

# Example-1 : Basic Multi-threading

This simple example spawns two threads. Callback function for each thread is invoked.

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <boost/thread.hpp>
void readerApi()
{
  for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
    usleep(400);
    std::cout << "readerApi: " << i
              << std::endl;
  }
}
void writerApi()
{
  for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
    std::cout << "writerApi: " << i
              << std::endl;
    usleep(400);
  }
}

int main()
{
  boost::thread readerThread(readerApi);
  boost::thread writerThread(writerApi);

  readerThread.join();
  writerThread.join();
}
{% endhighlight %}
